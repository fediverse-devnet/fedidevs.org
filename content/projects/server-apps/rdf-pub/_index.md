rdf-pub is a generic Activity-Pub Server. It supports (to be tested (-:) all you can think about that is representable in rdf (json-ld).
The first Version is tested with Notes. Next Object Type will be Events. After that it's going in direction to Organisations, food, Farmer etc.

## What functionality does rdf-pub provide on the Fediverse?

- It's a server, so it do not have a UI. Expect an admin UI.
- It supports Activity-Pub Client to Server Interactions [Activity-Pub C2S](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions)

## What interoperability does rdf-pub support on the Fediverse?

That has to be seen. Currently we test with Mastodon, Friendica, Mobilizon, Pixelfed, ...
