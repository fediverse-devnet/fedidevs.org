rdf-pub-demo-app is a client for [rdf-pub]({{< ref "/projects/server-apps/rdf-pub" >}}). It supports (to be tested (-:) all you can think about that is representable in rdf (json-ld).

rdf-pub-demo-app is designed for testing [rdf-pub]({{< ref "/projects/server-apps/rdf-pub" >}}), therefor it will maybe look a bit technical.
I am happy if there are UI web developers who want to develop an [Activity-Pub C2S](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions) compatible app and do this on the basis of rdf-pub. Just contact me.
